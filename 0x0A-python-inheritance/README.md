# Python Inheritance

Inheritance allows us to define a class that inherits all the methods and properties from another class.

## Parent class
The class being inherited from is called the parent class.

## Child class
The class that inherits from another class is called the child class.

Here is a simple example of Python inheritance:
python3 -m doctest -v ./tests/0-add_integer.txt
