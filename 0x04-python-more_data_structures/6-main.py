Write a function that prints a dictionary by ordered keys.

Prototype: def print_sorted_dictionary(a_dictionary):
You can assume that all keys are strings
Keys should be sorted by alphabetic order
Only sort keys of the first level (donâ€™t sort keys of a dictionary inside the main dictionary)
Dictionary values can have any type
You are not allowed to import any module

output :
Number: 89
ids: [1, 2, 3]
language: C
track: Low level
